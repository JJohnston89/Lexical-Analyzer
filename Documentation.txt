This project has three classes. The Main.class which is the driver, the Scan.class which implements a lexical analyzer, 
and the TokenRecord.class that holds the token type and its attribute.
This program takes in one file when the program executes, and output a file named tokens.txt. 
To run this program on the Osprey's server just type: p1 file_name.

The Main.class takes in a file from the command line, and validates the file to see if it exists or not. 
If no file was typed in the command line or the file does not exist, then the program will print an error message letting the user know if 
they forgot to type in a file or echo the file name back saying it does not exists then exit the program. If the file is validated then a Scan 
object is created, passing the file as a parameter to the constructor. The Scan object then calls the getTokens() method then returns to main(), and 
exit the program.

The Scan.class is the heart of this project by implementing a lexical analyzer. It outputs all the tokens into a file named tokens.txt. 
It has only one public method which is getTokens(), and a private method which is isKeyword(). The getTokens() method is simply two nested loops 
with a lot of nested if statements. The outer loop uses BufferedReader.class to read in a line at a time and echo the line to the screen, and to a file. 
The outer loop terminates when it reaches EOF. The inner loop reads each character of the line at a time checking to see if it is a white space, comment, ID, NUM, or any of the special 
tokens. If the char is a white space, then it continues to the next char. If the char is a '/', and the look ahead is another '/' then break, and get the next line. 
If the char is a '/', and the look ahead is '*' then we are in a multi-line comment and keep count of the depth, and every time we see a '*', and 
the look ahead is '/' then we subtract the count by one. When the count is zero then we know, we are out of the multi-line comment. 
If the char is a letter then the current token is ID, and keep appending until we see a char that is not a letter. Then the token value gets 
passed to isKeyword() which returns true or false. Then the token type and its value gets stored into a TokenRecord object. 
Then it prints out to the screen, and to a file. If the char is a digit, then the token type is NUM. If we see a '.' and the look ahead is not a 
digit, then print error. If we see an 'E' and the look ahead is not a digit or a '+' or a '-' then print error. Otherwise stored the token type and the 
token value into a TokenRecord object. Then print it to the screen and file. If the char is any of the special tokens, then it gets stored into a TokenRecord 
object then printed to the screen and file. If the char is not any of the tokens, then it prints error. 
The isKeyword() method implements a simple linear search that returns true or false; 

The TokenRecord.class just stores the token type and the token value. 
Its toString() method is used to print out to the screen, and to the file in the format "tokenType: tokenValue".
